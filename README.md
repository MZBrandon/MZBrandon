## Hi there 👋
Im Brandon, an aspiring IT professional with a strong focus on cybersecurity and computer science. I’m actively building my technical foundation by working on hands-on projects, experimenting with new tools, and exploring how systems are designed, secured, and maintained in real-world environments.

This is a fresh GitHub profile where I’ll be uploading:

Small but meaningful projects

Security experiments and lab work

Scripts, configurations, and automation ideas

Ongoing learning projects as I grow my skill set

My goal is to document my progress publicly, learn in the open, and continuously improve through practice and iteration.

  Areas of Interest

Cybersecurity fundamentals & defensive security

Networking, systems, and operating systems

Computer science concepts & problem-solving

Automation, scripting, and tooling

Learning how technology scales securely

🚀 Ambitions & Long-Term Vision

I have major ambitions and a long-term mindset when it comes to my career. I’m working toward becoming a highly capable and disciplined IT professional who understands both how systems work and how to protect them.

My focus is on:

Building deep technical skills, not just surface knowledge

Developing strong problem-solving and analytical thinking

Growing through consistent effort, not shortcuts

Creating a portfolio that reflects real learning and real work

This GitHub is part of that journey—every repository represents a step forward
