# Hey, I’m Brandon 👋

I’m an aspiring IT and cybersecurity professional focused on building real technical skills and a deep understanding of how systems work.

This is a fresh GitHub profile where I’ll be sharing smaller projects, labs, experiments, and work in progress as I continue learning and growing in tech.

## What I’m focused on
- Cybersecurity
- IT fundamentals and systems
- Computer science
- Hands on labs
- Adreniline rush


## Long term mindset
I have big ambitions, and I’m playing the long game.

This GitHub is part of that journey: learning in public, staying consistent, and getting a little better with every project.
